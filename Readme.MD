# Ski Microservice
Version: 1

The REST endpoints of this microservice are generated with openapi and swagger.

1) Steps to run:

Get docker from here:	https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/

2) Run "docker build ."

3) Run "docker-compose up"


Otherwise you will need an underlying native postgresql databse.
See application.properties for connection params with the datbabse.
No tests were implemented due to lack of time(if needed will add).
